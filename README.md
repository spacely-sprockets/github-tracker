## High-level objective

Design and build an issue tracker using GitHub public APIs. The assignment is scoped to 2-4 hours. Please let us know how much time you ended up spending once completed.

Below are some suggested features for the app. Getting through more of these features is better, but not at the cost of code quality or user experience. If you have other ideas for how to improve the app, feel free to try to impress us!

TODO: add a more opinionated feature suggestion

## Setup instructions

This repository is setup with a simple skeleton app. It includes:

- [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
- [Primer](https://primer.style/)

You are not at all required or expected to use this skeleton if you'd rather use something else. The skeleton is provided to you purely as a convenience.

If you do decide to use this skeleton, you can set it up with:

```
npm i
npm run build
npm start
```
